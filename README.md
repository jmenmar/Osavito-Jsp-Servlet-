# Osavito-Jsp-Servlet-
ADSI 2017/18 (EHU-UPV) project (sprint 2) (Jsp+Servlet+MySQL). In this second sprint I made a sanitary system web application with Jsp and Servlets which allows to ask for a date with patient's sanitaries as long as they can. The sanitaries have only a working hour which patients can ask for a date in. All data is storaged in SQL schema and the admin menu is omitted.
